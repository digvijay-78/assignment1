"""26. Sort Colors

You are given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, 
sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the 
color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Explanation:
The array has two 0s, 
two 1s, and two 2s. Sorting them in-place places all 0s first, then all 1s, then all 2s.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The array has one each of 0, 1, and 2, arranged in-place in the order 0, 1, 2."""
